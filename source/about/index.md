 I'm not a professional photographer! I like walking over mountains, sticks and stones and have my camera with me. In real life, my job is analyzing professional requirements for IT systems. When I have enough time I edit images with Lightroom or Photoshop and the rest of the time I try to understand Node, Angular, SASS as well as other technologies.

 Questions, nice words, not so nice words? Just send an email to <i class="fa fa-envelope mr-4"> [jan.weber123@googlemail.com](jan.weber123@googlemail.com)</i>

On Hiking with my cam the following equipment is included:

Fuji XE-1
